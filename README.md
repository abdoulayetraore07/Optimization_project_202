# 🖼️ Image Deblurring Project Using Iterative Optimization

## 📌 Description
This project focuses on **image deblurring techniques** using advanced optimization algorithms including the **Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA)**, its accelerated version **Fast ISTA (FISTA)**, and the **Douglas-Rachford Splitting algorithm**.

The implementation formulates image deblurring as an optimization problem with an $l1$ regularization penalty, demonstrating the practical application of forward-backward methods with Nesterov's acceleration.
